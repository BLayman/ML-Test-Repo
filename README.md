# ML-Test-Repo

The ".project" and ".pydevproject" files were added by eclipse, as well as the "__pycache__" folders.

Run main.py to see the order in which package file content is run. This is something I wasn't
aware of until I started playing around with it, so you might find it useful too.

Here's the console output (in case you're curious):


helpers init file

say init file

hello file top level code

goodbye file top level code

running code inside class

running main

hello

goodbye

in class constructor

parameter: 99

in class method
